# Sensor Station

Sensor Station is an Open Framework intended to help faciliate the
develop and deploy _Intelligent Online Techinologies (IoT)_.

Really, sensor station is Open Source Software as set of _Best
Practices_ built on _Open Protocols_ with reference applications. For
example, the only thing required of a "sensor station" is that it can
_publish_ to and _subscribe_ from MQTT channels, or _topics_.

To that regard, we have built two versions of _Sensor Station_, 1 st)
a Raspberry PI version and an pure embedded esp32 version.  Since they
all speak an opinionated formation of message channels, these
independent implementations can work to gether just fine.
